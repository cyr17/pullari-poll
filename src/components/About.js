          Why the Short Film Festival?<br />
          Pulari intends to create a thrilling platform for aspiring filmmakers and storytellers to showcase their creativity and talent concisely yet impactfully. The festival provides an avenue for filmmakers to
          explore their artistic expression, experiment with storytelling techniques, and communicate powerful messages to a diverse audience. Short films are concise cinematic works, and our festival serves as a
          stepping stone for emerging talent, offering opportunities for recognition and exposure. Pulari’s intention is to attract filmmakers from various backgrounds, cultures, and experiences to foster diversity
          resulting in viewers being exposed to a wide array of perspectives and storytelling styles to enrich their cinematic experience. In addition, the boundless creativity of filmmakers will connect diverse
          audiences with their captivating narratives and innovative techniques. Short films convey profound messages concisely, making them powerful tools for raising environmental and socio-cultural issues
